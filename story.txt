Once upon a time...
There was a city built by the sea. Most people worked at the paper airplane plant. Then one day everything changed... There was a billionaire who decided he wanted the town to himself and started replacing the humans with robots. These robot required giant batteries to recharge that began taking up space. People no longer to afford homes since all the land was being taken up by these changing stations. These robots also moved around the city with no regard for the human, if they were in the way they sinply ran them down. There was no law to protect the people since the billionare had so much influnce in the down.

...they all lived happily ever after
