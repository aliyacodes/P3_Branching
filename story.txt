Once upon a time...
There was a city built by the sea. Most people worked at the paper airplane plant. Then one day everything changed... There was a billionaire who decided he wanted the town to himself and started replacing the humans with robots. These robots required giant batteries to recharge that began taking up space. Leaving no place to live. People no longer could afford homes since all the land was being taken up by these changing stations. These robots also moved around the city with no regard for the human, if they were in the way they sinply ran them down. There was no law to protect the people since the billionare had so much influnce in the down.

At first the people though the robots must be programmed that way. As time when by people began to wonder if the robots were concious to the harm they were causing humans. No one knew how the robots were built so they had no idea how they worked. They were humaniod with silver metalic bodies like a statue that came to life. They did not walk as humans do, they had wheels like rollerskates on their feet. They would walk at times to get up stairs and such. Their face had no expression just a blank stare with yellow LEDs that glowed ominously if you saw one at night.


...they all lived happily ever after

but not for long, Lisa started to see someone else a guy named william.
